# machine_learning_for_streamflow

This is the training datasets prepared for the AGU CZO Pre-workshop Action Item for Learning Activity - Machine Learning for Streamflow Prediction in December 2019

Thanks for your interest in learning streamflow prediction using machine learning models. This learning activity presents several preliminary machine learning and deep learning model setups used in hydrological and environmental science. There are a few preparatory steps to save some time on Sunday.

1) Install Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
2) Install scikit-learn package (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/scikit-learn)
3) Install tensorflow (usually required the latest pip, see instruction https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
4) Some background reading that may be useful (https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/, https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-nested-cross-validation-76adba623eb9)

The demo datasets and jupyter notebook will be accessible at the workshop. Everyone is welcomed - knowledge of coding and machine learning algorithms are not required. We look forward to further exploring this new method with you all.
